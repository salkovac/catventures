# Clippy

The stars speak to Clippy. 

Sometimes. 

Sometimes the stars speak. Okay, so the stars spoke to Clippy yesterday for the first time. But he knew that was going to happen eventually. After spending so many moons learning the astrological arts, how could they not? Especially to someone who surpassed all his rivals. While they could barely switch the gravitational alignment of a small rock, while he could easily turn off the lights in the middle of the day.

Anyways, if he kept thinking about all that he was going to lose track of this dumb orange cat. Invisibility was simple for someone like himâ€¦ but tripping over his own invisible robe could make too much noise. The stars would not forgive him if he failed their simple task.
