In the late hours, the most colorful citizens of Cattaria come out to play. Drunkards stumble about, their drinks sloshing and spilling on their feet. Cats with slicked-back hair slink in doorways with flashing neon signs that promise fun. Catnip passes to eager hands.

It’s busy tonight. The nearby bar is hosting a rave, pumping out music at full blast, attracting those who want to forget for just a few more hours. In these tight alleyways with so many bodies intermingling, a sickly aroma filled with desperation pervades the space. Crimson always hated the smell. 

She walks into the crowd. Her claws easily maneuver around the bustling bodies, hooking into watches and bracelets and wallets. By the time the first cat notices their possessions are missing, Crimson is already two streets down.

When no one is around, she takes out a key she took from a hooded figure. It’s heavy in her paw. She’s hit the jackpot. Pure gold. She knows she should sell it as quickly as possible, but visions of riches are far too tantalizing. After all, if the key was made of gold, imagine what's behind the door it opens.
