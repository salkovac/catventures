Percy used to stalk the forest, tackling the most ferocious beasts from the wild boar to the mammoth black bear. But recently, the forests have been eerily quiet, only the wind rustling the branches. Percy hears an errant twig snap two clicks away and sprints there, leaping up to the canopy, pulls out her trusty bow and takes aim at a grotesque beast that has not been seen this far south for many moons.
