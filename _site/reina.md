# Reina

Reina reigns a small, quiet land. Sure, there’d sometimes be an errant beast stalking from the forest, but nothing that she couldn’t handle personally herself. The last wolf that strayed this far south thought it stumbled upon a land ripe for the taking. But Reina’s blade kept the beast at a distance, slicing some hair there, nicking a paw there. Just irritating enough to drive it off.

Reina’s morning routine always started with a view of the sunrise peeking over the daisy strewn knoll. A wisp of cloud sneaked in though. A smear of gray. A wall of smoke. A messenger running down the knoll with tales of fields alit by the impossible: bands of orange cats reminiscent of some society long forgotten in this area of the land.

Reina straps on her sword and heads off to protect her land.
