Orange hive mind is a society of cats that were once the smartest breed alive and had dominated the world, ruling with iron claws, until one day, a band of heroes managed to implant a mind virus that effectively lobotomized any cat connected at that time. Now, hundreds of years later, whispers began appearing of something unheard of for a long time: a rising force of orange cats that had escaped the long forgotten virus.
