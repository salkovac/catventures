Sonorous voices coming from the woods, over the city skyline and into one Penelope Pitterbottom’s ears. She trots to the window, each step a source of ecstasy. 

*Ding*

Penny’s axe had hewn many heads in defense of this grand city. It has never left her side, even now, as she scurried down the side of the building, its heft a comfort on her back. 

*Dong*

At the city gates, a black feline blocks her path, a sad smile across her face as she recognizes Penny, and she is too slow to raise her spear as Penny’s axe comes down on another fool in her way…

*Ding*

Her eyes flicker open. The clocktower strikes one more time as Penny can only look up at the ceiling, breathing heavy.
